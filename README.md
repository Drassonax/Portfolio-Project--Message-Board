This Anonymous Message Board allows users to participate in discussions with other people about any topic they desire. Any user can create a new board within the app, a new thread within any board and post replies to any thread. Users can report a thread or a single reply if they deem its content inappropriate, in which case the post will be flagged as reported. Any thread or post created by the user can be deleted by entering the correct password. Deleted threads will be entirely removed, but deleted replies will just have their content replaced by the word 'DELETED'. Users can submit posts by any username they desire on a post-by-post basis, it is not required (or even possible) to log in to participate in a discussion. This app uses MongoDB (via MLab) and Mongoose to handle the database. A combination of Node JS and React Router is used for routing.
